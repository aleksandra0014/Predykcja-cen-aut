# Car Price Prediction + Web Scraping

The project involves web scraping utilizing the Otomoto website - https://www.otomoto.pl/. The data extracted from the website was used for the analysis of car prices and properties. Additionally, I created 3 models for predicting car prices: linear regression, polynomial regression, and random forest. An interesting addition to conducting feature engineering is that I ran statistical tests to assess whether the feature affects predictions. 

Libraries used: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, requests, bs4
