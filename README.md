# Car Price Prediction + Web Scraping

The project involves web scraping utilizing the Otomoto website - https://www.otomoto.pl/. The data extracted from the website was used for the analysis of car prices and properties. Additionally, I created 3 models for predicting car prices: linear regression, polynomial regression, and random forest.

Libraries used: pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, requests, bs4
